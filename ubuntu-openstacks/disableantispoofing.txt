Mitaka + :
I was able to setup mikata where it does not create linux bridges. the config is a bit different.
On each controller and compute node

# /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini
[securitygroup]
firewall_driver = neutron.agent.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver
On the controller node

# /etc/nova/nova.conf
[DEFAULT]
security_group_api = neutron
firewall_driver = nova.virt.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver
Note that you need to make sure
enable_security_group = True
otherwise an instance cannot be launched and an error will be reported.
A firewall rule is still present, but it is in the flow table of br-int.

In Mitaka the anti-spoofing aren't anymore set in the IPtables instead they are implemented to in ovs flows.
if you want to disable the anti spoofing rules you should set prevent_arp_spoofing = false in the neutron ml2 configuration

Does it mean that Linux bridges do not work in Mitaka with security groups?

On Mitaka, "firewall_driver=openvswitch" on ml2 re-activate the Security Groups via new "ovs-firewall-driver", no more Linux Bridges in the middle, open-flow-based firewall. Pretty cool!
